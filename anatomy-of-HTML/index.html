        About Russian
    </h1>

    <p>The Russian language contains a whopping <strong>33</strong> letters.
        This includes two letters which make no sounds, <strong>ь and ъ</strong>.
        These influence the sound of the letter before them.
        The first is a soft sign which softens the sound of the previous letter.
        The second is the hard sign and does the opposite, increasing the emphasis on the letter.
